## What is this?

Created as a personal reference for learning about Docker. Following the official [Docker Tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/) for educational purposes

## Docker Concepts

- What is Docker? 
> Platform for developers & sysadmins to **build, share, and run** apps with containers. The method of using containers for deploying apps is called *containerization*.
- Why should we use Docker?
> Docker is a useful tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run apps by using containers. Containers allows a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
- Why is containerization so popular?
>- Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
>- Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel, making them much more efficient in terms of system resources than virtual machines.
>- Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
>- Loosely coupled: Containers are highly self sufficient and encapsulated, allowing you to replace or upgrade one without disrupting others.
>- Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas across a datacenter.
>- Secure: Containers apply aggressive constraints and isolations to processes without any configuration required on the part of the user.
